#### **Visualizations**
* **Region-Wise Total Sales:** A bar chart that visualizes and compares sales revenue across different geographical regions.
* **Gender Distribution:** A pie chart showing the breakdown of sales by customer gender.
* **Quantity-Wise Product Sale:** A horizontal bar chart that ranks product categories based on the total quantity sold.

## üí° Key Insights

This dashboard reveals several critical insights into the business operations:

* **Top Performing Region:** The **West** region is the highest contributor to total sales revenue, indicating a strong market presence or higher purchasing power in that area.
* **Dominant Customer Segment:** The customer base is predominantly **Male**, accounting for approximately **67%** of the transactions. This insight can be crucial for targeted marketing campaigns.
* **Best-Selling Category by Volume:** **Fashion** products are the most frequently sold items by quantity, highlighting their popularity among customers.
* **Discount Strategy:** **Electronics** receive the highest average discount rate (around 17.5%). This may be a deliberate strategy to boost sales volume or compete in a price-sensitive market.
* **Data Quality Concern:** The presence of a **"(Blank)"** category in the "Region Wise Sales" and "Quantity Wise Product Sale" charts points to incomplete data in the source file. Addressing this data gap is essential for achieving more accurate analysis.
